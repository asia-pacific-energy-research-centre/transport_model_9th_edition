#first created to help with producing the OGSS section on behavioural controls and their effect on energy security.
#Topics"
#1. when a car travels at a lower average speed, the wind resistance decreases and therefore the car requires less energy https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/transport/sl2.jpg/image_preview -  https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/transport/speed-limits-fuel-consumption-and
    # - In summary, whereas heavy goods vehicles speed limits in motorways are in line with the optimum speed in terms of energy and CO2 reductions per vehicle-km (80–90 km/h), decreasing car passenger speed limits in motorways could lead to substantial benefits.
    # to do this i would need: avg speeds per economy, accurate data on travel km per economy, effect of reduction in speed on efficiency in acutal numbers.
#2. Working from home: By analysing commuter trends and labour market data, we found that if everybody able to work from home worldwide were to do so for just one day a week, it would save around 1% of global oil consumption for road passenger transport per year. https://www.iea.org/commentaries/working-from-home-can-save-energy-and-reduce-emissions-but-how-much
    # -https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/average-change-in-energy-demand-and-co2-emissions-from-one-day-of-home-working-for-a-single-household-with-a-car-commute - cool chart
    # - . However, for short commutes by car (less than 6 kilometres in the United States, 3 kilometres in the European Union, and 2 kilometres in China), as well as for those made by public transport, working from home could lead to a small increase in emissions as a result of extra residential energy use.
    # - https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/change-in-global-co2-emissions-and-final-energy-consumption-by-fuel-in-the-home-working-scenario
    # - Working from home will normally reduce net energy demand for a household that commutes by car. But for commuters taking public transport, it is likely to increase net energy demand, although regional and seasonal differences are significant. Taking this into account, however, we find that during an average year, the overall energy saved as a result of less commuting is still around four times larger than the increase in residential energy consumption.
#3. car free sundays: - https://blog.gaijinpot.com/tokyos-pedestrians-paradise/
    # - does ginza car free snday have any effect on energy use? i doubt it
#4. incentivise public transport use
    # - cheaper? nz example. There are studies that show that price of transport is not very important to most users, instead it is about convenience and reliability and travel time. https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/16-05-2022/why-universal-half-price-public-transport-shouldnt-be-made-permanent
    # - other options that have proven value (there are many) https://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2022/05/12/would-at-rethink-the-eastern-busway/
#5. incentivise micro mobility walkign and biking 
    # - bike paths? etc.
    #SKATEBOARDS!
#6. increase occupancy and load factors
    #this we can defs do and show the effects of.
    # rural trips are best to implement car pooling but it is difficult to know the rural split of transport (or at least from what ive seen).
#7. econrouage freight efficiency improvements
#8. incentivise electric vehicles
#9. incentivise high speed and night trains instead of planes where possible.

    # We can use this style to compare the effect of different policies on energy use and point out actually what is worth looking into further GIVEN THAT ALL EOCNOMYS CANT DO 10 things AT ONCE.

    # The use of this is also that it will involve analysing effect of changes to different variables and how this actually changes the total transport economy. eg. how much energy does a 10% improvement in occ_load reduce? 
    #how does a decrease in activity from incentivising micro mobility walking and biking change things 
    # incentivising public transport use and the effect of more of that?
