The Aperc transport model is intended to provide a simple to use and understand model of transport energy economies. The input data has been limited to what was deemed essential. Itâ€™s structure is designed to be intuitive, and the code, easy to read.

The input data is based around the input data used for the APERC 8th edition outlook. So it contains two scenarios and 21 econmies.

I want it to be able to be used by people looking for a transport model they can use without having to write their own. If you are looking to do so but are stuggling then please jsut let me know so i can see what the issue is and whether this can be solved.


**I suggest looking at the files in documentation/. These explain the model a bit.**
